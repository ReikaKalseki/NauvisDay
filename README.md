Gaia's Revenge. Managing pollution is both more important and more detailed.
-----------------
Primary Features:
Pollution spread is much more aggressive, and will attract much more attention than in the vanilla game
Low-tier, coal-burning, and oil-processing machines generate much more pollution than before, offering further incentive for 'green' technology
Trees and non-paved terrain absorb many times more pollution, disincentivizing clearcutting and paving the world if pollution is a concern
Evolution factor now is much more affected by spawner destruction and slightly more by pollution, but without these actually drops slowly over time
Pollution can be filtered out of the air and dissolved into water, resulting in polluted sludge
Sludge can be processed into various forms, including sulfuric acid
Sludge can be stored into depleted oil wells, or simply vented into the air, re-releasing the pollution
Extreme pollution in an area can pollute the water, causing it to jam offshore pumps and cease absorbing pollution, until regional pollution levels drop again
(Optional) Gas-Powered Boiler, a cleaner-burning early-to-mid game steam producer
(Optional) Steam-Powered Furnace, a clean smelting solution
Adds a pollution meter for the circuit network


Secondary Features:
Protection from attacks in the very early game when they are guaranteed to be unsurvivable
Oil wells are no longer infinite; when reaching their minimum value, they convert to an "empty" well for pollution disposal (optional; empty wells generate as worldgen if disabled)
Destroying spawners unleashes a cluster of the spawner's progeny
