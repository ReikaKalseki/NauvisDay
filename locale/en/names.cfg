[mod-setting-description]
base-pollution-factor=A (decimal) multiplier for the pollution production. Multiplied against internal values. Increase this to make even MORE pollution. Lower bound clamped at 1.0.
acid-rain-threshold=The minimum amount of air pollution in a chunk before it can start spawning acid rain.
polluted-water-threshold=The minimum amount of air pollution in a chunk before it will start contaminating the water.
clean-water-threshold=The maximum amount of air pollution in a chunk before contaminated water will start cleaning again; MUST be much (several times cleanup) less than the polluting threshold or you get water flipping back and forth.
polluted-water-tile-cleanup=The amount of air pollution removed when a water tile turns polluted and if cleaned released when it turns back (multiplied against cleanup release factor).
polluted-water-tile-release-factor=The fraction (decimal) of pollution release (of that originally absorbed) when a polluted water tile converts back to clean water.
use-depleted-oil-for-well=Whether oil that reaches its minimum value should be converted to an empty well for pollution wells. If false empty wells (reskinned) generate in the world instead. You do NOT want to change this on existing worlds as the internal entity names are different.
steam-furnace=If you have another mod adding something similar, or do not want non-vanilla machines, you can disable the steam-powered furnace (ie a low-pollution smelting option).
gas-boiler=If you have another mod adding something similar, or do not want non-vanilla machines, you can disable the gas-powered boiler (ie a lower-pollution steam-production option).
clean-refinery=If you have another mod adding something similar, or do not want non-vanilla machines, you can disable the filtered refinery (a less polluting refinery). This is forcibly disabled with AAI installed because his recipes are not compatible.
wall-nukers=Whether to spawn a new enemy type in high-pollution areas at higher evolution factors - flying mobs that go near a defensive wall and blow a small hole in it.
wall-nuker-pollution=The minimum pollution a spawner must be surrounded by to spawn a Bomb Fly.
steam-furnace-speed=The relative speed of the steam-powered version of a furnace to its steel variant.
clean-refinery-speed=The relative speed of the filtered refinery compared to the base refinery.
attack-size=A multiplier to many biters can be in a specific attack wave, based on pollution and evo levels.
pollution-chem=A multiplier for how much sludge pollution chemical processing (eg into sulfuric acid) should consume. Set to zero to disable that processing entirely. Note that the design is supposed to be that processing is only a way to make some use of some pollution, not a way of disposing of all of it. This scales the outputs as well as the inputs.
pollution-chem-out=A multiplier for how much sludge pollution chemical processing should yield, to be combined with the base multiplier option. This option allows modifying the yield without modifying the sludge consumption.
