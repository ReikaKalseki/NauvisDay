[recipe-name]
air-cleaning-action=Filter Pollution
pollution-venting-action=Vent Pollution
pollution-binding=Pollution Binding

[technology-name]
pollution-capture=Pollution Handling
advanced-pollution-capture=Advanced Pollution Capture
pollution-processing=Pollution Processing

[technology-description]
pollution-capture=Taking pollution out of the air for processing and transportation.
advanced-pollution-capture=More effective and efficient means of filtering pollution out of the air.
pollution-processing=Transforming pollution into more manageable forms, or even useful ones.


[mod-setting-name]
base-pollution-factor=Base pollution factor
polluted-water-threshold=Water pollution threshold
clean-water-threshold=Water recovery threshold
polluted-water-tile-cleanup=Polluted water tile cleanup
use-depleted-oil-for-well=Use depleted oil fields for waste storage wells


[mod-setting-description]
base-pollution-factor=A (decimal) multiplier for the pollution production. Multiplied against internal values. Increase this to make even MORE pollution. Lower bound clamped at 1.0.
polluted-water-threshold=The minimum amount of air pollution in a chunk before it will start contaminating the water
clean-water-threshold=The maximum amount of air pollution in a chunk before contaminated water will start cleaning again; MUST be much (several times cleanup) less than the polluting threshold or you get water flipping back and forth
polluted-water-tile-cleanup=The amount of air pollution removed when a water tile turns polluted and if cleaned released when it turns back.
use-depleted-oil-for-well=Whether oil that reaches its minimum value should be converted to an empty well for pollution wells. If false empty wells (reskinned) generate in the world instead. You do NOT want to change this on existing worlds as the internal entity names are different.
