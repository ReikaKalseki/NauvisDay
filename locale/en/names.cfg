[mod-setting-description]
base-pollution-factor=A (decimal) multiplier for the pollution production. Multiplied against internal values. Increase this to make even MORE pollution. Lower bound clamped at 1.0.
polluted-water-threshold=The minimum amount of air pollution in a chunk before it will start contaminating the water
clean-water-threshold=The maximum amount of air pollution in a chunk before contaminated water will start cleaning again; MUST be much (several times cleanup) less than the polluting threshold or you get water flipping back and forth
polluted-water-tile-cleanup=The amount of air pollution removed when a water tile turns polluted and if cleaned released when it turns back (multiplied against cleanup release factor).
polluted-water-tile-release-factor=The fraction (decimal) of pollution release (of that originally absorbed) when a polluted water tile converts back to clean water.
use-depleted-oil-for-well=Whether oil that reaches its minimum value should be converted to an empty well for pollution wells. If false empty wells (reskinned) generate in the world instead. You do NOT want to change this on existing worlds as the internal entity names are different.
steam-furnace=If you have another mod adding something similar, or do not want non-vanilla machines, you can disable the steam-powered furnace (ie a low-pollution smelting option).
gas-boiler=If you have another mod adding something similar, or do not want non-vanilla machines, you can disable the gas-powered boiler (ie a lower-pollution steam-production option).
clean-refinery=If you have another mod adding something similar, or do not want non-vanilla machines, you can disable the filtered refinery (a less polluting refinery).
wall-nukers=Whether to spawn a new enemy type in high-pollution areas at higher evolution factors - flying mobs that go near a defensive wall and blow a small hole in it.
